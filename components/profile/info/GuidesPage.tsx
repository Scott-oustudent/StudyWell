            <h4>Using the Scheduler</h4>
            <p>Click the plus button to add new events like exams, assignment deadlines, or lectures. You can switch between a monthly calendar view and a chronological list view. Premium users can also generate an entire study plan using AI, and export their schedule.</p>

            <h4>Getting the Most out of the Pomodoro Timer</h4>
            <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Add tasks for your session, start the timer, and focus! Notifications will let you know when it's time for a break.</p>

            <h4>AI Note Taker</h4>
            <p>Our note taker is more than just a text editor. Use the AI Assistant to summarize your notes, find action items, or improve your writing. Free users can create up to 5 notes.</p>
